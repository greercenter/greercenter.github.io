For newsletter icons: 
* screenshot an the image to use in the newsletter
* open the clip in gimp
* scale the image so the largest dimension is 250
* resize the canvas to the other dimension is 250
* position the image as desired w/in the canvas

To reduce the size of the newsletter: Drop it into the Adober compression tool (I googled it)
